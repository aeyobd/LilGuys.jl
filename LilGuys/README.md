## Notes about structure and conventions

### Units
All internal code is in special code units, where G = 1, M = 1, R = 1, and t = 1.
the units file will contain methods to covert to physical units

### Objects

1. `Point` - a point in 3D space
2. `PhasePoint` - a point in 6D phase space
2. `Particle` - points


### Strucutre
- units.j
- coordinates.jl: contains methods to convert between galactocentric and geocentric frames
- gravity.jl: gravitational methods: profiles, forces, and potentials
